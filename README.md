#Print F Project
@ALX First Collaborative Work

This is the first collaborative project as part of the ALX SE program. In teams of two, we are to custom-build a printf function for the C programming language called \_printf. This function takes various inputs and optional arguments to mimic how the standard library function printf works. You can find the collaborators name (@JoshAmpofo and @James-koduah) on the collaborator section.

This function **\_printf()** writes output to the standard output stream with the format and options without making use of any of the standard library files. It was written to use a local buffer of 1024 bytes when printing although it can print larger sets of data.
The \_printf() function returns the total number of characters printed to the stdout(excluding the null byte at the end of strings) after a successful execution.
If an output error is encountered, a negative value of -1 is returned.
